# tokenized-generative-assets

The supply chain of tokenized generative assets can involve several steps, which may include the following:

- Data extraction: The process of collecting data from various sources, such as weather data, social media data, or financial data, to be used as input for the generative algorithm.
- Data providers: The companies or organizations that provide the data, such as weather services, social media platforms, or financial institutions.
- Generative algorithm: The computer program or algorithm that uses the input data to generate the artwork.
- Creation: The generative artwork is created using the algorithm, and the digital artwork is stored on a computer or server.
- Tokenization: The digital artwork is converted into a non-fungible token (NFT) that is recorded on a blockchain. The NFT serves as a digital certificate of ownership for the artwork, and it can be bought, sold, and traded on various online marketplaces.
- Listing: The NFT is listed for sale on various online marketplaces, such as OpenSea, SuperRare, or Nifty Gateway. The listing includes information about the artwork, such as the artist, the number of copies available, and any special features or attributes.
- Sale: The NFT is purchased by a buyer, who receives the digital certificate of ownership for the artwork. The buyer may keep the artwork or resell it on a secondary market.
- Storage and delivery: The digital artwork and the NFT are stored in a digital wallet, which can be accessed by the owner using a private key. If the artwork is physical, it may need to be stored or delivered to the buyer.
- Royalty payments: If the artwork is sold again in the future, the original artist may be entitled to a percentage of the sale price as a royalty payment, which can be automatically programmed into the smart contract associated with the NFT.
- Impact investors who invest in NFTs can generate monetized digital assets through the purchase of tokenized generative artworks. Institutions that buy these NFTs may use the resulting profits to invest in activities that support the initial philanthropic cause, such as environmental or social initiatives. Examples of such institutions include museums, galleries, or private collectors who may choose to display the artwork or keep it as an investment. By investing in NFTs, these institutions can not only support philanthropic causes, but also potentially benefit financially from their investment.

The exact supply chain may vary depending on the specific platform or marketplace used for the sale of the tokenized generative asset, as well as the specific data sources and generative algorithms used to create the artwork.
